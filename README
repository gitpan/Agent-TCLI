VetNetSec version 0.0.0

This suite allows one to run tests for Network Security device functionality.


INSTALLATION

To install with Module::Build, one can use the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Alternatively, one may load from CPAN, or hopefully a PPM repository.

There are a few buggy perl modules that have fixed versions shipped with
this collection. No response from the authors to queries has been received.
	Net::XMPP::Protocol -> Changed, fixed verson on on CPAN and required.
	POE::Componenent::SimpleLog -> has a bug which would seriously impact performance

USING

Passive Bots:
One creates a script, see ex/eliza.pl or ex/attack.pl, that loads up a TCLI
transport with users, packages and other pertinent information.
The bot will log in, join chatrooms if in the user list,
and wait for further commands from authorized users or in a chatroom.

Test script:
A test script is written, see ex/target.pl, that loads up a Test Transport,
other necessary transports, necessary local packages, and testees.

Using testees, one creates tests ala Test::More with the is_code or like_body
tests. These may run asynchronously after the testing starts.

It is necessary to call the test_master->run at the end of the test to ensure
that all tests have completed.
