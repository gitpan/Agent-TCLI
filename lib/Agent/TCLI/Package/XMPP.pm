=head1 NAME

Agent::TCLI::Package::XMPP - A package of commands to access the XMPP transport

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Agent::TCLI::Package::XMPP version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 INTERFACE

These are all required interfaces for commands. Others may be added ac necessary.

=cut

use warnings;
use strict;

use POE;
use Agent::TCLI::Command;
use Agent::TCLI::Parameter;
use Agent::TCLI::User;
use Getopt::Lucid qw(:all);

use Object::InsideOut qw(Agent::TCLI::Package::Base);

our $VERSION = '0.0.'.sprintf "%04d", (qw($Id: XMPP.pm 42 2007-04-02 20:20:14Z hacker $))[2];

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

The following attributes are accessible through standard <attribute>
methods unless otherwise noted.

These attrbiutes are generally internal and are probably only useful to
someone trying to enhance the functionality of this Package module.

=cut

=head2 METHODS

Most of these methods are for internal use within the TCLI system and may
be of interest only to developers trying to enhance TCLI.

=head2 new ( hash of attributes )

Usually the only attributes that are useful on creation are the
verbose and do_verbose attrbiutes that are inherited from Agent::TCLI::Base.

=cut

=head3 _preinit

This private Object::InsideOut (OIO) method is used for object initialization.

=cut

sub _preinit :Preinit {
	my ($self,$args) = @_;

	$args->{'name'} = 'tcli_xmpp';

  	$args->{'session'} = POE::Session->create(
      object_states => [
          $self => [qw(
          	_start
          	_stop
          	_shutdown
          	_default

			change
			establish_context
			peer
			show
			shutdown
			)],
      ],
  	);

  	$args->{'opt_args'} = [qw( group_mode group_prefix verbose )];

}

=head3 _init

This private OIO method is used for object initialization.

Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: peers
  help: list the peers
  manual: >
    This debugging parameter can be used to list the peers currently
    loaded in a transport.
  type: Switch
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: controls
  help: list the controls
  manual: >
    This debugging parameter can be used to list the controls currently
    loaded in a transport.
  type: Switch
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: xmpp_verbose
  aliases: verbose|v
  constraints:
    - UINT
  help: an integer for verbosity
  manual: >
    This debugging parameter can be used to adjust the verbose setting
    for the XMPP transport.
  type: Counter
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: group_mode
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: sets how the control processes group chats
  manual: |
    The group_mode tells the control how to determine if a group chat
    message is directed at itself. The possible settings are:
        all - treat everything from others as a command
        log - ignore everything from others, only use chatroom for logging
        named - only accept commands prefixed by the name followed by a colon
        prefixed - only accept commands prefixed by the group_prefix,
          by default a colon
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: group_prefix
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: sets the prefix used in group chats
  manual: >
    The group_prefix sets the prefix used by the group_mode prefixed option.
    By default, it is a colon.
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: id
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: the user id
  manual: >
    ID of user in a form acceptable to the protocol.
    XMPP/Jabber IDs MUST not include resource information.
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: auth
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: Authorization level of user.
  manual: |
    Authorization level of user. MUST be one of these values:
      reader - has read access
      writer - has write access
      master - has root access
      logger - receives copies of all messages, can't do anything

    Note that commands must choose from the above to determine if a user can
    do anything. Not very robust, but hey, it's not even 1.0 yet.

    Every user should be defined with an B<auth>, but currently this is not
    being checked anywhere.
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: protocol
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: Protocol that user is allowed access on.
  manual: >
    Protocol that user is allowed access on. Currently only xmpp and
    xmpp-groupchat are supported by Transport::XMPP. If the protocol
    is xmpp-groupchat, the Transport will automatically join the
    conference room when the user is added.
  type: Param
---
Agent::TCLI::Parameter:
  name: password
  constraints:
    - ASCII
  help: A password for the user.
  manual: >
    A password for the user. For a private XMPP chatroom,
    this is used to log on. It is not used anywhere else currently.
  type: Param

    sessions may continue. The delete command will accept all the same
    parameters as the add command, although it ignores everything
    but the id.

      @_[KERNEL, OBJECT,  SENDER,     ARG0, ];

=head3 shutdown

This POE event handler executes the shutdown command.

=cut

sub shutdown {
    my ($kernel,  $self, $sender, $request, ) =
      @_[KERNEL, OBJECT,  SENDER,     ARG0, ];

	$request->Respond($kernel, "Shutting down transport_xmpp");
	$kernel->post('transport_xmpp' => '_shutdown');
}

=head3 start

This POE event handler executes the start command. It is not exactly clear
when this would be useful currently, but we have a shutdown command and
balance must be maintained. Hopefully other transports will be available
in the future and this command might be more useful.

=cut

sub start {
    my ($kernel,  $self, $sender, $request, ) =
      @_[KERNEL, OBJECT,  SENDER,     ARG0, ];
	$self->Verbose("start: request ".$request->id );

	$self->Verbose("start: sending start to transport_xmpp");
	$request->Respond($kernel, "Starting transport_xmpp");
	$kernel->post('transport_xmpp' => '_start');
